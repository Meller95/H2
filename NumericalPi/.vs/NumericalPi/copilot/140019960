The higher the number ofiterations, the closer the ratio will come to \u03C0/4. The final estimate is then easy to calculate, as is done in the Calculatemethod.Suppose you had to do this calculation manually. You could e.g. draw the square and circle on a piece of paper, and throwa dart at the paper e.g. 100 times. You should then count the number of times the dart has hit within the circle. Say the dart hit within the circle 77 times. Your estimate of \u03C0would then be (4.0 * 77) / 100 = 3.08.Steps1.You invite three friends over to help with your experiment. A total of four persons can now throw darts. How will you utilise this to speed up the experiment?2.See if you can translate your redesigned experiment into a new version of Calculate, where you use Taskobjects (Hint: wrap the code corresponding to what oneperson should do, into a Taskobject, like Task task1 = Task.Run( () =\u003E {...});)3.Compare the running time of your new version of Calculatewith the original version. How much faster is your version?4.See if you can figure out how many cores your CPU has.

The new version should be faster if your machine has multiple cores, as the tasks can run in parallel.\n\n4. **Figuring out how many cores your CPU has:** You can use the \u0060Environment.ProcessorCount\u0060 property in .NET to get the number of processors on the current machine. The speedup you observe when using tasks should be related to this number. If you have a single-core processor, using tasks won\u0027t speed up the calculation as the tasks can\u0027t actually run in parallel. But if you have a multi-core processor, you should see a significant speedup.\n\nRemember, the speedup won\u0027t be exactly four times even if you have four or more cores, due to the overhead of managing multiple tasks and other processes running on your machine.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["Can you explain more about tasks in C#?","How does parallel processing work in .NET?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
