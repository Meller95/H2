First,you will rectify the shared data problem you experienced in Exercise Threads, using amutex or a semaphore. Then, you will create a generic (template) class that ensures atomicaccess to the data it protects.PrerequisitesIn order to complete this exercise, you must:\u2022have completed ExercisePro 5.1ThreadsGoalWhen you have completed this exercise, you will.\u2022To make you able to differentiate between different kinds of a mutex and semaphores anddecide which one is the right one for synchronization issues.\u2022To give you routine in defining and using thread synchronization mechanisms\u2022To make you understand how a template class can automate thread synchronization issues.ProjectThreadsDescriptionThe problem in Exercises Sharing data between threadsand Sharing a Vector class betweenthreadsfrom Pro 5.1 Threadsis that all threads share and utilize a resource and that resource isnot protected. This is illustrated in the fact that a thread could necessarily complete its reador write operation uninterrupted. When a thread was interrupted in the read or write of theshared resource, the shared resource could be left in an inconsistent state and an error wouldbe reported. This problem can be rectifiedusing a mutex/semaphore.Exercise 1 Mutex and/or SemaphoreDoes it matter, in both scenarios described above, which of the two is used? Present yourarguments1.Exercise 2 Using the synchronization primitiveFix the problem for both scenarios. Verify that your solution works for the second scenario.1If you experienced problems with the first scenario verify it as well otherwise just fix it.\r\nExercise 3 Ensuring proper unlockingThe method for data protection in Exercise 2 has one problem. The programmer is not forcedto release the mutex/semaphore after he updates the shared data. Using the Scoped Lockingidiomcan enforce this.The idea behind the Scoped Locking idiom2is that you create a class ScopedLockerwhich ispassed a Mutexon construction. TheScopedLockertakes the Mutexobject in its constructorand holds it until its destruction -thus, it holds the mutex as long as it is in scope.Implement the class ScopedLockerand use it in class Vectorto protect the resource.

If a thread has locked the Mutex, any other thread that attempts to lock it will block until the first thread releases the Mutex.\n\nA Semaphore, on the other hand, controls access to a shared resource through the use of a counter. If the counter is greater than zero, the Semaphore can be acquired, and the counter is decremented. If the counter is zero, threads attempting to acquire the Semaphore block until the counter is greater than zero.\n\nIn your case, you are using a Mutex (the \u0060lockObject\u0060 in your \u0060Vector\u0060 class) to ensure that only one thread can execute the \u0060SetAndTest\u0060 method at a time. This prevents multiple threads from concurrently modifying the \u0060vector\u0060 array, which could lead to inconsistencies.\n\nFor Exercise 2, you\u0027ve already implemented the synchronization primitive (Mutex) in your \u0060SetAndTest\u0060 method. This should fix the problem of shared data between threads.\n\nFor Exercise 3, you need to ensure that the Mutex is always released after the shared data is updated. This can be achieved by using a \u0060ScopedLocker\u0060 class. This class would take a Mutex object in its constructor and hold it until its destruction, ensuring that the Mutex is always released when it goes out of scope.\n\nHere\u0027s a simple implementation of a \u0060ScopedLocker\u0060 class:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\npublic class ScopedLocker : IDisposable\n{\n    private readonly object _mutex;\n\n    public ScopedLocker(object mutex)\n    {\n        _mutex = mutex;\n        Monitor.Enter(_mutex);\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        Monitor.Exit(_mutex);\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nYou can use this \u0060ScopedLocker\u0060 class in your \u0060SetAndTest\u0060 method like this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\npublic bool SetAndTest(int n)\n{\n    using (new ScopedLocker(lockObject))\n    {\n        Set(n);\n        return Test(n);\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis ensures that the \u0060lockObject\u0060 Mutex is always released, even if an exception occurs within the \u0060Set\u0060 or \u0060Test\u0060 methods.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["Can you explain more about the IDisposable interface?","How does the \u0060Monitor.Enter\u0060 and \u0060Monitor.Exit\u0060 methods work?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
