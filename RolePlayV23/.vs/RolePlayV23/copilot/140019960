Any character in the\r\ngame is represented by an object of the class Character.\r\nSteps \t\r\n\r\n1. Get an overview of the application. The central class is the Character class, which implements a generic game character. Also note the code in Program.cs, where two teams with two members are set up for battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In the Character class, open the region Virtual Properties and Methods. Make sure you understand the purpose of these properties and methods. Note that you must not change anything in the Character class when you solve the next steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Create a class Defender, which derives from Character. A Defender has a 45 % chance of having the received damage reduced by 50 %. Implement this in the Defender class by overriding relevant properties and methods (i.e. the virtual properties/methods which are inherited from Character). Once you have created the class, update the code in Program.cs to include a Defender on each team.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Create a class Damager, which derives from Character. A Damager has a 40 % chance of dealing double damage. Implement this in the Damager class by overriding relevant properties and methods (i.e. the virtual properties/methods which are inherited from Character). Once you have created the class, update the code in Program.cs to include a Damager on each team.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Reflect a bit on how we implemented the two derived classes. If we were allowed to make changes to the Character class, could we then implement the requirements from step 3) and 4) without having to create two new derived classes?","Context":{"VisibleDocuments":[],"PreSelectedSkill":null,"CorrelationId":{"Guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}}},"Response":{"Content":"\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\npublic class Defender : Character\n{\n    public Defender(string name, int hitPoints, int minDamage, int maxDamage) : base(name, hitPoints, minDamage, maxDamage)\n    {\n    }\n\n    protected override int ReceiveDamageModifyChance\n    {\n        get { return 45; }\n    }\n\n    protected override int CalculateModifiedReceivedDamage(int receivedDamage)\n    {\n        return receivedDamage / 2;\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nResponseType: Code\nFile: Damager.cs\nContent:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\npublic class Damager : Character\n{\n    public Damager(string name, int hitPoints, int minDamage, int maxDamage) : base(name, hitPoints, minDamage, maxDamage)\n    {\n    }\n\n    protected override int DealDamageModifyChance\n    {\n        get { return 40; }\n    }\n\n    protected override int CalculateModifiedDealDamage(int dealtDamage)\n    {\n        return dealtDamage * 2;\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nResponseType: Code\nFile: Program.cs\nContent:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\n// Assuming the existing code for setting up teams\nTeam team1 = new Team(\u0022Team 1\u0022);\nTeam team2 = new Team(\u0022Team 2\u0022);\n\n// Adding a Defender and a Damager to each team\nteam1.AddCharacter(new Defender(\u0022Defender 1\u0022, 100, 10, 20));\nteam1.AddCharacter(new Damager(\u0022Damager 1\u0022, 100, 10, 20));\n\nteam2.AddCharacter(new Defender(\u0022Defender 2\u0022, 100, 10, 20));\nteam2.AddCharacter(new Damager(\u0022Damager 2\u0022, 100, 10, 20));\n\n// Continue with the existing code for the battle...\n\u0060\u0060\u0060","Type":1,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":null},"SelectedFunctionName":"Generate","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
