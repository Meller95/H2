The \u0060Largest\u0060 method takes three objects of type \u0060T\u0060 and returns the largest one.\n\nThe \u0060Largest\u0060 method works by initially assuming the first object (\u0060obj1\u0060) is the largest. It then compares \u0060obj1\u0060 with \u0060obj2\u0060 and \u0060obj3\u0060 using the \u0060CompareTo\u0060 method.

The \u0060Weight\u0060 property is not part of the \u0060IComparable\u003CT\u003E\u0060 interface, so there\u0027s no guarantee that \u0060T\u0060 will have this property.\n\nThe strength of the original \u0060Largest\u0060 method is that it can work with any type \u0060T\u0060 that implements \u0060IComparable\u003CT\u003E\u0060, making it very flexible.
