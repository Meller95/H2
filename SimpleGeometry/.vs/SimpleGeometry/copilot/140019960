See polymorphic behavior in action.\r\nDescription \tThe project contains the (abstract) base class Shape, with an abstract property Area. The class also contains a static method FindTotalArea, that should calculate the total area of a list of shapes. The project also contains two derived classes Circle and Rectangle, which are not yet complete.\r\nSteps \t1. Implement the property Area correctly in Circle and Rectangle, using the\r\navailable instance fields (if you need the value of \u03C0 (pi), you can get it by\r\nwriting Math.PI).\r\n2. In the Shape class, implement the FindTotalArea method correctly, such\r\nthat it finds the total area of a list of shapes.\r\n3. Take a look at the code in Program.cs. It contains a small test of the\r\nclasses in the project. Make sure you understand what the test does.\r\n4. Run the application, and see if the output matches your expectations.\r\n5. Why is it possible for the FindTotalArea method in the Shape class to work\r\ncorrectly, even though the Area property is defined as abstract?","Context":{"VisibleDocuments":[],"PreSelectedSkill":null,"CorrelationId":{"Guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}}},"Response":{"Content":"The purpose of overriding abstract methods is to provide the specific implementation of a method that has been declared, but not yet defined, in an abstract base class. This is a key aspect of polymorphism, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.\n\nIn your project, the \u0060Shape\u0060 class is an abstract base class with an abstract property \u0060Area\u0060. This means that any class that inherits from \u0060Shape\u0060 must provide an implementation for \u0060Area\u0060.\n\nFor the \u0060Circle\u0060 and \u0060Rectangle\u0060 classes, you can implement the \u0060Area\u0060 property like this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\npublic class Circle : Shape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n\n    public override double Area\n    {\n        get { return Math.PI * Math.Pow(Radius, 2); }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : Shape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n\n    public override double Area\n    {\n        get { return Width * Height; }\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe \u0060FindTotalArea\u0060 method in the \u0060Shape\u0060 class can be implemented as follows:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\npublic static double FindTotalArea(List\u003CShape\u003E shapes)\n{\n    double totalArea = 0;\n    foreach (var shape in shapes)\n    {\n        totalArea \u002B= shape.Area;\n    }\n    return totalArea;\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThe \u0060FindTotalArea\u0060 method works correctly even though the \u0060Area\u0060 property is defined as abstract in the \u0060Shape\u0060 class. This is because when \u0060FindTotalArea\u0060 is called, it uses the overridden \u0060Area\u0060 property of the actual object type (either \u0060Circle\u0060 or \u0060Rectangle\u0060), not the abstract \u0060Area\u0060 property in the \u0060Shape\u0060 class. This is a demonstration of polymorphism, where a base class reference is used to refer to a child class object.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["Explain more about polymorphism","How can I optimize the FindTotalArea method?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
